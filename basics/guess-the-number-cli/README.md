# Guess The Number (CLI)

A simple terminal-based number guessing game built with Python.

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it correctly. After each attempt, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high or too small.

## Concepts Used

- Variables
- While loops
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- User input handling
- Random number generation
- Basic control flow

## How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user enters a positive integer.
3. The program compares the guess with the secret number.
4. Feedback is given:
   - "Too small"
   - "Too high"
5. The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.
6. The program displays the total number of attempts.
